Tool data into google chart api from collectd driven rrd db on linux
Creates pretty charts for your data's


Install:

1. install and configure collectd server and clients
2. install merb on server.  currently worked with 1.0.4 and 1.0.12
3. edit config file rcr.yaml, specify rrdtool location, and rrd data dir
4. run merb in rrdcrunchr directory


Bugs:

Ignore the calendar, RRD Sample Interval will set how far back the data goes
RRD Sample Interval needs to be multiple of 60
If there is no RRD for a given host error is not pretty
